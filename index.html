    <h1>Kristie Dahlia Home</h1>
    <main>
      <p>
        I wish I could show you the pure light that is my true being, but here I
        can only try to say it with words.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love being.
      </p>
      <p>
        My parents named me Kristie. I chose Dahlia for myself when James and I
        married and chose Home for our family name.
      </p>
      <p>
        I decided to be a writer when I was nine. At different times, I have
        described myself as a poet, a teacher, a healing artist.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I speak to myself inside my own mind, I call myself by terms of
        endearment. If I were to speak to you, I would call you by terms of
        endearment.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love.
      </p>
      <p>
        The exploration and explication of love and freedom are the work of my
        life.
      </p>
